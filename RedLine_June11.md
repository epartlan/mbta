# June 11 Derailment

The [June 11 derailment](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/06/11/second-derailment-days-sends-into-chaos/gN77BdGXdkDQGDD8zewnxM/story.html) of the Red Line resulted in a few injuries and significant delays. The incident occurred just a week after another derailment occurred on the Green Line. 

June 11 was a Tuesday, and just the day before, more than 400 trains ran in both directions on the Red Line. When the derailment occurred on Tuesday morning, the frequency of trains dropped by more than half, with less than 200 trains running that day. Crews scrambled to make repairs and get trains running, but the number of trains didn’t pick up again until Friday of that week.

It’s been three weeks now since the derailment, and there are about 300 trains running on the Red Line during the weekdays. We are still not back up to regular operating capacity due to repairs at JFK/Mass where the derailment occurred. In contrast with the MBTA’s goal of [3 min](https://mbta.com/news/2018-10-01/mbta-awards-signal-upgrade-contract-red-and-orange-lines) between trains at rush hour, wait times at rush hour now average 7 minutes.

MBTA is expecting to be making repairs [throughout the summer](https://www.patriotledger.com/news/20190621/red-line-repairs-to-last-through-summer).In fact, the sensors that track trains passing are broken between JFK/Mass and Broadway and data there is not being logged. Data from Park St. and Downtown Crossing are used to represent the Red Line.

When was the last time that the Red Line was so severely crippled, resulting in long times between trains? The reality is that it hasn’t. In the past year, weekdays have seen about 400 trains per day without fail. The weekends have dropped to about 200 trains per day from a normal number of just shy of 300 trains due to maintenance work.

The last time there was a major loss of performance, though minor relative to the effects of the derailment, was around October 8, 2018. What happened to cause a gradual decrease in the number of trains and then to slowly ramp performance back up?
